#Local Storage

### Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
So we can store the user information they enter.
### What information should not be stored in local storage?

### Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing it?
Local storage only stores `String`, if you want to store something else you need to convert then into `String` using `JSON`.
