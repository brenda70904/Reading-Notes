### Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
    - Grid container: To make an HTML element behave as a grid container, you have to set the `display` property to `grid` or `inline-grid`.
    - Grid item: a container has one grid item for each column, in each row, but you can style the grid items so that they will span multiple columns and/or rows.
    - Grid line: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”)
