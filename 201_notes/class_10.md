# What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.
### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax errors usually refer to spelling errors, we might type too fast and spell words wrong. Logic errors refer to the code being executed but it’s not giving you the result you want it. 
### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
Some syntax errors, I notice that if you lick the words on vs code it will highlight all the syntax that is the same, that’s how I check if something is supposed to highlight but if it was not, then I would know there’s a spelling error. Logic errors usually will need to ask TA for help. 
### How will this topic continue to influence your long-term goals?
Keep it in mind that when debugging, check the syntax first and then check if there’s logic incorrect.

It’s a very powerful tool to help software developers find the problem and fix it
