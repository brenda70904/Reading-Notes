### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
    - Greater efficiency
        According to the article “when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. 
        Research indicates that pair programming takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting 
        and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product).”  
        I am a person who prefers quality over quantity and delivering high-quality products it’s always my goal. Having someone catch each other’s mistakes or reorganized their thought 
        will help each other learn faster. 
     - Social skills. 
        According to the article  6 Reasons for Pair Programming.“This has long-term career impacts. 
        As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others.” 
        I am sure if someone is willing to refer you to their company, that means you are not just a good software developer but also showing you 
        have the ability to work with ther.
