# HTML form

### Why are forms so important in web development?
Because it can collect data from users.
### When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
Only ask what you want to know from users when creating forms. 
### List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
The `<fieldset>` element is a great way to create a group of widgets that share the purpose. Use `<legend>` to tell the purpose of `<fieldset>`. 
`<labbel>` when a user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the input (this increases the hit area). 
`<input>` specifies an input field where the user can enter data.
`<button>` for submitting the form.
