# Reading notes

### Prep your mindset

After reading the article “Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice”, I thought about my learning journey from high school all the way to now. I was impatience and always want to see the result immediately, and of course, I didn’t get anything done or actually learn anything. After I graduated from UW, I got a job as a preschool teacher. I started to realize how impatience I was and how does that affect my learning attitude. To make a long story short, you can’t expect someone to learn a big chunk of new skills overnight. What we have to do is to set a small, achievable goal that teaches us something and steps out of our comfort zone at the same time. 
In addition, I really enjoy the concept of the “Growth Mindset”. As a preschool teacher, one of the jobs is to help children find the joy of learning, using “not yet” helps children understand that they are on their way to achieving the goal. 


### Emotional Intelligence and Bias 
For the assessment for emotional intelligence, my score for self-awareness is 21, self-management is 22, social awareness is 21, and relationship management is 21.
For Bias Self-Assessment Results my score is 110 with the “you have high self-awareness, curiosity, and courage” comment.
While I was completing the assignment, I realized that as preschool teachers, we were trained to be sensitive to others' emotions and try to understand the cause. I’ve been a preschool teacher for over 5 years with a prior study experience in college year, and seeing the result made me realize how much I had learned from the education field! 
Although I had the privilege of my previous work experience, I know that I still have a lot to learn, and the last question caught my attention. I am not a person who likes conflict.  When my opinion is not accepted by others at that moment, I am willing to wait to see the result before I propose my opinion.
