## Discussion Questions

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
One thing I bring to this tech field is open-mindedness and resilience. I really love how Mark Rober uses Super Mario Effect to explain how we should see our learning journey, therefore, one thing I bring to my new career is to see the challenge in different ways and be resilient to face the challenge. 

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
First of all, ASK for help. I will definitely take advantage and use all the resources Code Fellows give to us. If  I feel frustrated when I am stuck. I take a short break, I grab some snacks/ drinks. Eating always helps me calm down. If I am still stuck, I will move on to something else and come back to this problem later. 

### Things I want to know more about
  I want to know more about how other people "un-stick"!
