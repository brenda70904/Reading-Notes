# Web Sockets

### What is a Web Socket?
WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, that provides communication channels over a single TCP connection. 

### Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.
The Web Socket request/response handshake is a process that begins with an HTTP request from the client and ends with an HTTP response from the server. Once the connection is established, the client and server can exchange data back and forth without the need for additional HTTP requests.

### Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.

## Socket.io Tutorial
### What does the event handler io. on() do?
Make connection
### Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected
console.log()
### What does socket.emit() do?

## Socket.io vs Web Sockets
### What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).
The main difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO is that Socket.IO is a library that provides an abstraction layer over the WebSocket protocol, allowing for easier and more secure use of the protocol, as well as additional features such as automatic reconnection, event broadcasting, and binary data support.
### When would you use Socket.IO?
When building a communication channel 
### When would you use WebSockets?
Online gaming or video streaming
