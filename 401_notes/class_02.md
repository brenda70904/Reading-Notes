# An introduction to NodeJS and Express

### Explain middleware, and answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

Middleware is for handling the different routing of the webpage and it works between the request and response.

> Express the most popular **_Node_ Web framework** .

### Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

it has particular ways to handle particular tasks.

### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
Easier to manage, debug and test.

# What is NPM?

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

9.3.1

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

npm i

# What is TDD?

### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

You write a test to test if the outcome going to be what you expect. this will help reduce the time of coding. Instead of writing the whole app and then finding out there’s a bug, using a test can help you eliminate the problem.

### What are three expected benefits of testing
- Reduce the time of debugging
- Increase the initial development effort
- Improve the design quality

### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
individual mistakes : 
  - forgetting to run tests frequently
  - writing overly trivial tests, for instance omitting assertions
Team pitfalls:
  - partial adoption – only a few developers on the team use TDD
  - oor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time

# CI/CD

### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
- Ensure everyone’s changes integrate
- Catch bugs 
- Reduce merge conflicts

### What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

Continuous Delivery develops to release at any time, continuous Deployment deploys new features immediately. 
### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
