### What type of database is the best fit for the complex query-intensive environment?
  - NoSQL database

### What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?
  - NoSQL database

### Describe the differences in scalability between a SQL and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.
SQL is like a table, you store data in different kinds of table, but you will need to identify which section store what 
NoSQL is like you going to a store, it has different kinds of collections and you can search for what you want based on the type..etc. 


###  Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?
one-to-many relationship is when one record in a table can be related to multiple records in another table. This is usually done by having a foreign key in the “many” table that references the primary key of the “one” table. This allows us to link the two tables together and query data from both.

### Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to create a diagram of the database tables and their relationships.


### Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.
A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It is used to ensure data integrity and to create relationships between tables. A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. It is used to create a relationship between two tables and to ensure data integrity.

### How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?
Keywords are words that are part of the SQL language and are used to define the structure of a query. Parameters are values that are passed into a query and are used to filter the results. Keywords are written in all uppercase and parameters are written in lowercase.

### Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.
Normalization is a process used to organize data within a database by dividing large tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them, as well as ensuring that all data follows the same format.

### Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.
- One-to-one: husband to wife
- One to many: husband to children
- Many to many: friends to friends
