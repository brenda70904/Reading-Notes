## [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

### What is an EC2 Instance?
An EC2 Instance is a virtual server provided by Amazon Web Services that allows users to run their applications on the cloud. It provides scalable computing capacity and can be thought of as a virtual machine that runs on the cloud. Users can choose from different instance types and can configure EC2 instances to run with other AWS services to provide a complete cloud infrastructure for their applications.

### Name 2 use cases for EC2.
dynamic website, Big Data Processing

### Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.
One reason to use Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com is greater flexibility and control over the underlying infrastructure.

### Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
T2 Micro instances are designed for low-cost, low-resource applications that don't require much computing power.T2 Micro instances are designed for low-cost, low-resource applications that don't require much computing power. T2 XL instances, on the other hand, are designed for high-performance, high-resource applications that require more computing power.

### Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
if you want to bake a cake, you need to go through a series of steps like mixing the batter, pouring it into a pan, and baking it in the oven. In computing, a compute cycle is like one of those steps.


## [Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)

### What is Elastic Beanstalk?
Elastic Beanstalk is a cloud service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easier to deploy, manage, and scale web applications and services.

### Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
EC2 is a cloud-based virtual machine that provides computing resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, for running applications. Elastic Beanstalk, on the other hand, is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of web applications.

### Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
Elastic Beanstalk is a simple, scalable, and cost-effective way to deploy and manage web applications.
