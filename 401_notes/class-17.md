### Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.
"Serverless" refers to a way of building and running software applications without having to worry about managing and maintaining the underlying servers or infrastructure.

This enables developers to focus on writing code and delivering value to users, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
