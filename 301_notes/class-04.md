## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

### Why would we use a ternary operator?
Because sometimes we need to write a condition statement, the ternary operator will work perfectly in React when you write in HTML tag.  
### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
    if(x===y){
      console.log(true);
    } else {
      console.log(false);
    }

x===y ? console.log(‘true’) :console.log(‘false’)
